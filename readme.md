## Mod 1 Project 1: Number Guesser

The number guesser is a game in which the user guesses a number between the number ranges on the screen. The game provides feedback - higher or lower- until the user accurately guesses the number. When the user has honed in on the correct number, the game says "BOOM!", resets the secret number and expands the range of numbers.

The user can input their guess and adjust the min and max values at the beginning of the game. The user can also press the following buttons when they are enabled:
#####"Guess" button: submits the user's guess and is enables when a value is present in the in the "Enter your guess" field.
#####"Clear" button: clears the "Enter your guess" field.
#####"Reset" button: resets the game, including the random number and min and max range.
